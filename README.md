# Alexa Emotion Analyzer
### Let Alexa analyze the emotion of your sentences.

This skill relies on the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API to accurately determine which emotion is most articulated in your sentences. The possible emotions are anger, disgust, fear, joy, and sadness. Scores of over 75% indicate a very high likelihood that emotion is present in your sentence while scores of less than 50% indicate a low likelihood that the emotion is present.
